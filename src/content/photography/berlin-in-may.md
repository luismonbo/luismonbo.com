Berlin in May sits in that narrow window between the grey of winter and the tourist crush of summer. The trees along the Spree have just filled in, and the light stretches past nine in the evening.

I brought only HP5+ for this trip. Black and white felt right for a city that wears its history so openly -- the bullet holes still visible in building facades, the stolpersteine set into sidewalks.

The FM2 is perfect for this kind of wandering. No batteries to worry about, no menus to navigate. Just aperture, shutter speed, and focus. You learn to see differently when the camera gets out of your way.

The cafes in Kreuzberg spill out onto the sidewalks this time of year. People sit for hours with a single coffee, reading or watching the street. There is a patience to this city that rewards slow photography.
