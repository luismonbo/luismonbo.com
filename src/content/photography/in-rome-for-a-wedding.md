We flew in two days early for the wedding. The ceremony was in a small church near Piazza Navona, but I spent most of my time in Trastevere with the M6 and three rolls of Portra 400.

The winter light in Rome has a quality you do not find in summer. It is softer, more directional, and the streets empty out just enough that you can see the architecture without the crowds.

The cobblestones hold the rain differently here. Each one is worn smooth by centuries of foot traffic, and in the low afternoon sun they take on this warm golden tone that Portra renders beautifully.

On the day of the wedding I left the Leica at the hotel and just watched. Some moments are better without a viewfinder between you and the world.
