		<h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight mt-16 mb-6">What I Do</h2>
		<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
			I work at the intersection of machine learning, software engineering, and product development.
			My focus is on taking AI research and turning it into production systems that people actually use.
		</p>

		<h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight mt-16 mb-6">Beyond Engineering</h2>
		<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
			When I'm not coding, I shoot analogue photography and write about politics, philosophy, and technology.
			These pursuits keep me grounded and remind me that not everything needs to be optimized.
